Have you ever had the perfect picture but closed your eyes? ðŸ¤¦ It is a very common issue, you can fix it by going to Photoshop and editing the picture there.... But why not let an AI to do the hard work for us?

### Demo
You can find a demo in the following link: [https://overflow.ai/open-eyes-using-pix2pix](https://overflow.ai/open-eyes-using-pix2pix)

### Motivation
The idea of this project had been in my head for a long time, I couldn't find the time to carry it out. Then the Youtuber [DotCSV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy5znSnfMsDwaLlROnZ7Qbg) launched the challenge [#RetoDotCSV2080Super](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNgAaCK920E) where you have to build a project using Pix2Pix model. So perfect timing to start to code.

### Dataset
This was the first big challenge. As you may know there is no dataset for people with open and closed eyes.  The dataset *Closed Eyes In The Wild(CEW)* is very useful but does not have a data labeled by person with open/closed eyes.

So what I propose is to generate the dataset **manually** with the help of OpenCV. Basically I take a picture from CEW dataset and overlay on it the eyes of a random photo of the UTKFace dataset. Then I manually clean the patches using Photoshop.

I did this process several times until I achieved a final dataset of **48 samples**.

### Training process
GIF: From FacePatcher image to (hopefully) Photoshop level

### Results

### Future work and improvements
 - In order to achieve **better accuracy** it is necessary to increase the dataset samples and this way try with more interesting approaches to solve the task.
 - Currently the output of the app is a 256x256 picture. The output is only for the face, so a nice thing to do would be to **overlay** the result on the original photo.
